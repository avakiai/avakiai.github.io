I’m a doctoral candidate in neuroscience at the [Ernst Strüngmann Institute for Neuroscience](https://www.esi-frankfurt.de/) in Frankfurt, Germany, working with Julio Hechavarria (Ernst Strüngmann Institute/Freie Universität Berlin.

In my PhD, I study vocal production in echolocating bats using a combination of bioacoustic, behavioral, and *in vivo* electrophysiology techniques. 

Previously, I worked on auditory statistical learning in humans working as a researcher in the [Neuroscience Department](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/department-of-neuroscience.html) at the [Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en.html). 

Prior to that, I completed my masters in the [Cogmaster](https://cogmaster.ens.psl.eu/en) (PSL/ENS) in Paris, during which time I worked on time perception in humans. I received my bachelors at New York University.
