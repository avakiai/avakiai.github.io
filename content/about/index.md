Iâ€™m a doctoral candidate in neuroscience in the [Auditory Computations Lab](https://www.julio-hechavarria.com/) at [Goethe University (Institute for Cell Biology & Neuroscience)](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/45912568/Institute_of_Cell_Biology___Neuroscience) in Frankfurt, Germany.

I'm interested in how the brains of humans and other animals process sounds and produce vocalizations. In my PhD, I use bats as a model organism to study how the mammalian brain supports vocal production in complex and social environments. I use a combination of bioacoustic, behavioral, *in vivo* electrophysiology, and computational modelling techniques to do this. 


Previously, I worked on auditory statistical learning in humans while I was a researcher in the [Neuroscience Department](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/department-of-neuroscience.html) at the [Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en.html). 

Before that, I completed my masters in the [Cogmaster](https://cogmaster.ens.psl.eu/en) (PSL/ENS) in Paris, during which time I dabbled in experiments on time perception in humans. 

I received my bachelors at New York University.


Outside of the lab, I enjoy reading, outdoor sports, tango dancing, and playing classical violin in amateur orchestras.
