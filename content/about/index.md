Vocal communication is ubiquitous in the mammalian kingdom and astounding in its richness and diversity. My first scientific fascination was the neural representation of speech, and the neurobiological basis of language processing. How is it that soundwaves arriving upon the ear are so rapidly converted to meaning? How is the hierarchical structure of syntax fluently understood, when the acoustic input is necessarily linear?

Some years ago, I began reading books by some of the great early ethologists, like Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen, as well as contemporary figures like Frans de Waal and Jane Goodall. Their insights into the complexity of social organization and communication in non-human animals inspired a switch to the study of animal vocal communication, this time using tools from systems neuroscience. I was inspired by, among others, the observation that fundamental systems of information processing in the brain are [preserved across species](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627313009045). 

I believe in the potential of a comparative, cross-species approach for illuminating how fundamental properties of vocal production and processing have evolved - in humans, as well as in our near and distant cousins.

### What I'm Up To

Iâ€™m a doctoral candidate in neuroscience in the [Auditory Computations Lab](https://www.julio-hechavarria.com/) at [Goethe University (Institute for Cell Biology & Neuroscience)](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/45912568/Institute_of_Cell_Biology___Neuroscience) in Frankfurt, Germany.

In my PhD, I study the vocal behavior of a species of neotropical fruit bat (Seba's short-tailed bat, *Carollia perspicillata*) to help us better understand the neural mechanisms that support vocal production in complex and social environments. I use a combination of bioacoustic, behavioral, *in vivo* electrophysiology, and computational modelling techniques to do this. 

I'm supported by a Main-campus-doctus PhD Scholarship from the [Stiftung Polytechnische Gesellschaft](https://www.sptg.de/).

Previously, I was a researcher in the [Neuroscience Department](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/department-of-neuroscience.html) at the [Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en.html). Before that, I completed my masters in the [Cogmaster](https://cogmaster.ens.psl.eu/en) (PSL/ENS) in Paris, and my bachelor at New York University.
