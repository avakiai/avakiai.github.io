Back in November, I had a great experience talking to a couple classes of 4th graders about bats. As part of the online scientist-teacher matching program, #SkypeaScientist, I linked up with 
[Mrs. Phaedra Taft](https://twitter.com/taftphaedra1) at an elementary school in Connecticut. 

We talked about bat ecology, their hearing and vocal abilities, and their natural history. It's 
been a while since I've spoken to 4th graders and I was pleasantly surprised at their sophistication 
of their questions. (A tip to academics: Perhaps try explaining your research to older elementary school kids.) One highlight was the question: "Are there mute bats?"
