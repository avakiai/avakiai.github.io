[Here](https://universalprior.substack.com/p/hello-dall-e) is an essay I wrote for my friend [Jan's Substack](https://universalprior.substack.com/), talking about the importance and possible future impact of DALL-E and similar algorithms. 

Jan is a super smart and freshly minted PhD who just started working at OpenAI, the company that produced DALL-E as well as groundbreaking natural language processing algorithm, GPT-3. He kindly gave me access to DALL-E for this piece. 

I hope you enjoy reading it and would be glad to hear your feedback!
