In an effort to translate my existing workflows into a format that's both resilient and open source, I've migrated to a new site!

News from ongoing projects and any future essays or general-purpose tutorials will show up here. 

Essays on more politicized matters will remain over at my [Substack](https://avakiai.substack.com/). 

Thanks for reading! More soon...
