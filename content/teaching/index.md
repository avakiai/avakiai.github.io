## Courses

Currently, I'm teaching an undergraduate course on experimental psychology. The course combines traditional lectures, tutorials, and a substantial practical component in which students must carry out an experiment, analyze data, and finally interpret and present their results. 

The course relies almost entirely on open source software, and all materials are freeling available to access [here](https://avakiai.github.io/expra_winter2021-2022/index.html). 


## Curated Materials

I maintain a list of [resources](https://github.com/avakiai/Scientific-Resources) useful for data/scientists on Github. I'll turn this into a git/jupyter book soon, but for now the .md files can be found as a repository.
