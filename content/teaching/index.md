## Courses

In the winter semester 2021-2022, I taught an undergraduate course on experimental psychology. The course combined traditional lectures, tutorials, and a substantial practical component in which students carried out an experiment, analyze data, and finally interpreted and presented their results in a poster session. 

The course relied uniquely on open source software, and all materials are freeling available for viewing and reuse [here](https://avakiai.github.io/expra_winter2021-2022/index.html). (If you would like to reuse any materials or data from the course, please get in touch and remember to include the appropriate credit.)


## Curated Materials

I maintain a list of [resources](https://github.com/avakiai/Scientific-Resources) useful for data/scientists on Github. I'll turn this into a git/jupyter book soon, but for now the .md files can be found in the linked repository.
