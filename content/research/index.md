My research focuses on acoustic jamming avoidance, social vocalizations, and the neural basis of vocal adaptation in bats. My current research program breaks down into three major topics: 

## Study 1: Talking in a noisy world

How do bats adapt parameters of their calls to avoid acoustic jamming from each other and from environmental noise? Many bats, including our model species *Carollia*, have rich vocal interactions and also navigate use biosonar. But these signals are subject to acoustic interference, that may make them unintelligible. Indeed, background noise is ubiquitous in natural settings, and vocalizing animals must actively adapt to changing noise in order to ensure their vocalizations are heard by others. For a great introduction to the issue of acoustic communication in noise, see [this review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065345405350042) by Henrik Brumm and Hans Slabbekoorn. 

In an ongoing study, we use bioacoustics and electrophysiology to study how bats overcome acoustic jamming and how various brain regions coordinate to generate optimized vocalizations.

## Study 2: Turn taking in a vocal learning animal

*Carollia* is a species of the family *Phyllostomidae*, that features several [vocally talented bat species](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2019.0061#d3e427). *Carollia* as well as their cousins are not born with a fixed and unchanging vocal repertoire. Rather, these species' vocal abilities develop in the course of infancy, and adults retain the ability to produce new or varied vocalizations. 

In this study, we examine whether *Carollia* engage in in systematic [turn-taking](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.0598), where communication calls are emitted in turns and listeners wait until the current speaker has stopped calling to begin their turn. Turn-taking is believed to underlie complex social interactions and to be an evolutionary precursor of human language, but has not yet been observed in this species.

## Study 3: Causal neural mechanisms of vocal adaptation

Finally, we are interested in how neural assemblies coordinate to actively sample the acoustic environment and produce vocalizations. [Previous research](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000658&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosbiology%2FNewArticles+%28PLOS+Biology+-+New+Articles%29) from our group highlights the role of oscillatory activity in selectively producing biosonar and social communication calls in *Carollia*.

In this study, we will probe the causal role of key regions in the vocal production network responsible for the vocal adaptation behaviors discussed above. Using electrical stimulation, we will selectively target different brain areas, such as the frontal auditory field and auditory cortex, to activate and perturb the vocalization system and hopefully gain insight into the mechanism underlying vocal learning in this species.
