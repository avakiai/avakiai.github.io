My research focuses on social vocalizations, acoustic jamming, and the neural basis of vocal plasticity in bats. My research program currently breaks down into three major questions: 

First, how do bats adapt parameters of the calls to avoid acoustic jamming from each other and from environmental noise? Relatedly, do they engage in systematic [turn-taking](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.0598)? Using bioacoustic and behavioral methods, I'll examine the effect of different types of noise playback and social compositions on emitted vocalizations.

Second, how is rapid vocal adaptation to external noise instantiated in the bat brain? Using in vivo electrophysiology, I'll look at how various brain regions coordinate their activity to monitor environmental noise and generate optimized vocal signals (whether for navigation or communication).

Finally, what is the causal role of key regions in the vocal production network? Using electrical stimulation and/or pharmacological deactivation, I'll selectively target different brain areas (such as the frontal auditory field, auditory cortex, and/or midbrain structures) to activate/perturb the vocalization system. Specifically, we will consider what role ocillatory mechanisms play in coordinating complex vocal responses to the environment.
